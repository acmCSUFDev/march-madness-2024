### Part 2
As time went one, running is no longer a challenge to the crew.

Diamond had a brilliant idea of using here favorite prime number 138739 to increase the distance of everyone

Example:
```
Diamond ran 7 to 10
Justin ran 2 to 5
Pillow ran 1 to 7

is actually

Diamond ran 7 to 1387390
Justin ran 2 to 693695
Pillow ran 1 to 971173
```

Also, Diamond's favorite primes has now became 138739 and 90001039 to accomodate for her new found ambition

For each person, what is the sum of the steps they have taken between those two prime streets (inclusive)

Give the max out of the 3 friends

The input is the same as part 1
