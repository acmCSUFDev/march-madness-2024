### Part 1

Diamond, Justin and Pillow loves running. 

Every time they run, the record which street they start on and where they finish.

They have been training for a long time such that it only take them 1 foot step to clear a street!

Example:
```
Diamond ran 1 to 10
# Diamond took 1 step each for each street from 1th to 10th (inclusive)
```

Diamond is fascinated by prime numbers, her two favorites are 19 and 419 and "xor" bit operation

For each person, if xor=1, what is the xor of all the steps they have taken between those two prime streets (inclusive)

Give the max out of the 3 friends

Example:
```
In this example, Diamond's favorite primes are 3 and 7

Diamond ran 1 to 10
Justin ran 2 to 5
Pillow ran 4 to 9

Diamond: 5 steps total betwen 3 and 7
Justin:  3 steps total between 3 and 7
Pillow:  4 steps total between 3 and 7

Here 5 is the answer!
```
