Part 2
As time went one, running is no longer a challenge to the crew.

Diamond had a brilliant idea of using here favorite prime number 138739 to increase the distance of everyone

Example:
```
Diamond ran 7 to 10
Justin ran 2 to 5
Pillow ran 1 to 7

is actually

Diamond ran 7 to 1387390 (138739 * 10)
Justin ran 2 to 693695 (138739 * 5)
Pillow ran 1 to 971173 (138739 * 7)
```

Also, Diamond's favorite primes has now became 138739 and 90001039 to accomodate for her new found ambition

Diamond is fascinated by prime numbers, her two favorites are 19 and 419 and "xor" bit operation

For each person, if xor=1, what is the xor of all the steps they have taken between those two prime streets (inclusive)

Give the max out of the 3 friends

The input is the same as part 1
