# Empty Spaces

In preparation for March Madness, our beloved Mr. Marketing Eric Ly has set out with a team of his goons to go and gather the necessities for the events! Things like plates, napkins, water, energy drinks, and whatever else they feel like grabbing while at Sam's Club will be brought back to the CSUF Computer Science building and stored in one of the rooms. This room will be the base of operations for the event organizers, so it's important we ensure that it is well-suited for our needs.

After getting in touch with the CS department, you've been given a floor plan of the room in which you're allowed to store your supplies. The floor plan is a large text file indicating which spaces are in use already. Here's a portion of one of the floor plans:

If it's too hard to tell from the picture, the floor plan text file consists of the characters `.` and `#`, where a `.` represents an empty space in the room, and the `#` represents a 1m<sup>2</sup> space taken up by something in the room you are not allowed to move. Eric is eager to make sure things go smoothly, so he's asked you to provide him with information about the room you guys have been given.

## Part 1

The people over at Sam's Club have just been grabbing stuff all willy-nilly. Eric decided to check in with you to make sure that they aren't overdoing it. **How many m<sup>2</sup> of free space do we have in our storage room?**

## Part 2

The March Madness organizers just got their funds approved by Eric. They ordered 5,000 sandwiches from Lee's Sandwiches to feed everyone throughout the event. The crate containing all these sandwiches takes up a 15x15 area. **How many different places can we fit this crate in our storage room?**
